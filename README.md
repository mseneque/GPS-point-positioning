# GPS-point-positioning

This was one of my uni projects way back in 2009. My commenting practices were terrible back then. Hopefully I will get some time to update this code, and possibly port it to Python or JavaScript.

## Description
This is GPS software to determine point coordinates in a Single Point Positioning mode using only C/A Code measurements. All of this currently is in Matlab Code.
